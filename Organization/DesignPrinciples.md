## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.

## Fitts’s Law

The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

## Doherty Threshold

Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

## Gall’s Law

*Gall’s Law* states that all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time.

First clause argument - The first cause argument is based around cause and effect. The idea is that everything that exists has something that caused it, there is nothing in our world that came from nothing. As human beings we are used to seeing cause and effect in our everyday lives, so this argument is easy to relate to.

## Hick’s Law

The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

## Jakobs Law

Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

## Law of Prägnanz

- People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
- The human eye likes to find simplicity and order in complex shapes because it prevents us from becoming overwhelmed with information.
- Research confirms that people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures.

## Less but Better

Focus on its double meaning. By doing less, we can improve ourselves because we gain time and energy. By doing **less, we will have more**. When I feel overwhelmed, I remind myself of Rams' philosophy “Weniger, aber besser.” Less, but better.

We delight in complexity in which genius has reduced to simply

## Miller’s Law

The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.

## Tesler’s Law \ Conservation of Complexity

- Tesler’s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
- All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.
- Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.
- Take care not to simplify interfaces to the point of abstraction.
- While working for Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s, Larry Tesler realized that the way users interact with applications was just as important as the application itself. The book Designing for Interaction by Dan Saffer, includes an interview with Larry Tesler that describes the law of conservation of complexity. The interview is popular among user experience and interaction designers. Larry Tesler argues that, in most cases, an engineer should spend an extra week reducing the complexity of an application versus making millions of users spend an extra minute using the program because of the extra complexity. However, Bruce Tognazzini proposes that people resist reductions to the amount of complexity in their lives. Thus, when an application is simplified, users begin attempting more complex tasks.
- ***The total complexity of a system is a constant. If you make a user’s interaction with a system simpler, the complexity behind the scenes increases.***

## Postel’s Law

Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.

Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.

The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.

Accept variable input from users, translating that input to meet your requirements, defining boundaries for input, and providing clear feedback to the user.

## Peak-End Rule

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the “end”) of the user journey.

Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight the end user.

Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.

## **Zeigarnik Effect**

It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
