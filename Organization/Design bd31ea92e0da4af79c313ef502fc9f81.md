The objective is not to mimic greatness but to calibrate our internal meter so we can make the thousands of decisions that will ultimately lead to our own great work 

Take out the obvious option and see what other options are left. Dan Carlin 

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

Trust those who seek the truth but dought those who found it.

## Somebody Else's Problem Field

- An S.E.P. can run almost indefinitely on a torch or a 9 volt battery, and is able to do so because it utilises a person's natural tendency to ignore things they don't easily accept, like, for example, aliens at a cricket match. Any object around which an S.E.P. is applied will cease to be noticed, because any problems one may have understanding it (and therefore accepting its existence) become Somebody Else's Problem. An object becomes not so much invisible as unnoticed.

## First clause argument / evolution / inevitable happening / tellers law / galls law

The first cause argument is **based around cause and effect.** The idea is that everything that exists has something that caused it, there is nothing in our world that came from nothing. As human beings we are used to seeing cause and effect in our everyday lives, so this argument is easy to relate to.

## Tesler’s Law \ Conser

- Tesler’s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
- All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.
- Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.
- Take care not to simplify interfaces to the point of abstraction.
- While working for Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s, Larry Tesler realized that the way users interact with applications was just as important as the application itself. The book Designing for Interaction by Dan Saffer, includes an interview with Larry Tesler that describes the law of conservation of complexity. The interview is popular among user experience and interaction designers. Larry Tesler argues that, in most cases, an engineer should spend an extra week reducing the complexity of an application versus making millions of users spend an extra minute using the program because of the extra complexity. However, Bruce Tognazzini proposes that people resist reductions to the amount of complexity in their lives. Thus, when an application is simplified, users begin attempting more complex tasks.
- ***The total complexity of a system is a constant. If you make a user’s interaction with a system simpler, the complexity behind the scenes increases.***

Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.

Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.

The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.

Accept variable input from users, translating that input to meet your requirements, defining boundaries for input, and providing clear feedback to the user.

## Peak-End Rule

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the “end”) of the user journey.

Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight the end user.

Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.

## **Dieter Rams** Ten Principles of “Good Design”

After studying architecture at the Werkkunstschule Wiesbaden, the highly awarded
and respected Dieter Rams landed a job at the architectural firm of Otto Apel
(1953). Two years later, he left the firm and joined the product company Braun,
where he created a legacy. Within the 40 years of working at Braun, Rams pro-
duced and oversaw over 500 innovative products as chief of design. Many of his
designs are featured in museums throughout the world.

[](https://hovie.com/10PrinciplesGoodDesign.pdf)

### **Good Design Is Innovative :**

The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means,
exhausted. Technological development is always offering new
opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always
develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never
be an end in itself.

### **Good Design Makes a Product Useful :**

A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,
not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic.
Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while
disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.

### **Good Design Is Aesthetic :**

The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
because products are used every day and have an effect on
people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be
beautiful.

### **Good Design Makes A Product Understandable :**

It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the
product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s
intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.

### **Good Design Is Unobtrusive :**

Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither
decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should
therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the
user’s self-expression.

### **Good Design Is Honest :**

It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable
than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer
with promises that cannot be kept

### **Good Design Is Long-lasting :**

It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears
antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even
in today’s throwaway society.

### **Good Design Is Thorough Down to the Last Detail :**

Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in
the design process show respect towards the consumer.

### **Good Design Is Environmentally Friendly :**

Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It
conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution
throughout the lifecycle of the product.

### **Good Design Is as Little Design as Possible :**

Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the
products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity,
back to simplicity.

## **12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos**

### **Rule 1: Fix your Posture**

All animals, including humans, are governed by dominance hierarchies and involuntary biochemical responses. Lobsters, for example, battle for dominance. During a confrontation, 2 lobsters size each other up using their body/claw sizes and chemical secretions (which signal their health, strength and mood). Dominant lobsters have higher serotonin levels, project greater confidence, a better posture, and can fight longer. An alpha lobster typically “wins” without even having to fight physically.

After each confrontation, a lobster’s brain changes—the loser avoids further conflict, whereas the victor gains even higher confidence and serotonin levels. Similar patterns can be found in other animal species—generally, stronger animals get more food, better “homes”, higher status, better mates, and greater cooperation from others. That’s nature’s way of distributing scarce resources.

Likewise, humans have a dominance detector in our brain. How we perceive our social/economic status affects our well-being which reinforces our status in a positive feedback loop.• People with strong self-esteem feel/transmit a sense of security and confidence, which makes them more attractive and respected. This improves their productivity and well-being, which further reinforces their self-perception. Higher serotonin levels are associated with greater resilience, happiness, health, lifespan, pro-social behavior and leadership.• On the other hand, people with a low self-perception feel insecure. They’re more likely to be stressed, jumpy and reactive. They make poor decisions, fail to command respect/resources, which reinforce their loser complex.

In short, our self-perception affects the vibes we transmit to create a self-reinforcing loop. If you feel like a loser for whatever reason, the first step is to break the negative cycle by correcting your posture.• **Don’t slouch**. It conveys defeat and a low status, which prompts others to treat you poorly and reinforce your low self-perception.• **Fix your posture**. Stand straight, push your shoulders back, speak up and make eye contact. This signals confidence to yourself and others. You’ll feel better, others will show you more respect, and it starts a virtuous cycle. It’s about standing tall, facing up to reality and taking responsibility to become all you can be.

### **Rule 2: Care for yourself like how you’d care for someone else**

We tend to take better care of our pets than we do ourselves. When a pet is sick, we diligently follow the prescribed care. Yet, when we’re sick, we fail to fill/take our prescriptions. In **[the book](https://amzn.to/2O3wF6W)** and our **[full book summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/)** we look at how our self-loathing loathing plays a part and how to counter it.

### **Rule 3: Surround yourself with people who want the best for you**

We become the average of the people we spend the most time with. In the wrong company, we can end up in crime or even suicide. So, why do we hang around people who drag us down? 

### **Rule 4: Improve your own game instead of playing others’**

In a highly-connected, populous world, you can always find someone who’s better than you—be it in looks, wealth, status or relationships. No matter what you’ve achieved, you can still feel miserably inferior compared to others. In **[the book](https://amzn.to/2O3wF6W)** / **[full summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/)** you can find out how to improve your own game, make your life progressively better, and fundamentally shift your viewpoint.

### **Rule 5: Teach your children to abide by society’s rules**

Children aren’t born with social-cultural skills—they must be taught how the world works and how to navigate human society. Parents who don’t set clear boundaries for their young kids actually end up hurting them in the long run. Find out why/how from our complete 12 Rules of Life summary and learn the 5 principles to help your kids become well-liked.

### **Rule 6: Get your own house in order before criticizing others**

Setbacks and suffering are inevitable in life. Some people respond with denial, helplessness, anger, or even acts of vengeance (e.g. genocide). Yet, others are positively transformed by adversity—they make peace with what happened and devote themselves to making a positive difference. Which type are you? Read more on why/how to get your own house in order first, from [the book](https://amzn.to/2O3wF6W) / [full book summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/).

### **Rule 7: Focus on a higher purpose, not instant gratification**

We can use suffering as an excuse to live carelessly in the moment, or we can do something meaningful to minimize the suffering. In our **[complete 15 page summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/)**, we share more insights on discovering who we are and what values to live by.

### **Rule 8: Find your personal truth and live it**

All of us are guilty of lying to ourselves and others. In [the book](https://amzn.to/2O3wF6W) / [full summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/) you’ll learn why we lie, how we get stuck in a “life-lie” because and what it means to find and live your personal truth.

### **Rule 9: Learn to be a good listener**

People need a listening ear. As a good listener, you can learn while helping others to solve problems. In the full version of our 12 Rules of Life summary, we explain how talking helps people to think, how to be a good listener, and get the most from your conversations.

### **Rule 10: Define your problem precisely to make it manageable**

We avoid looking deeply into a problem in hope that it’ll go away by itself, but this only causes the doubts and uncertainties to build up into a catastrophic failure. Get more details from **[the book](https://amzn.to/2O3wF6W)** or **[full  book summary](https://readingraphics.com/product/download-12-rules-for-life-summary/)** on why/how to use specificity to bring order to chaos.

### **Rule 11: Accept that inequality exists**

Some postmodernists argue that gender is entirely a social construct or a tool for men to oppress women, and that hierarchies are created by the rich to exploit the poor. Peterson disagrees. 

### **Rule 12: Take time to appreciate the good things in life**

Suffering is inevitable and some people just seem to have a worse lot in life than others. Peterson’s own daughter suffered from a rare juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and was plagued with years of chronic pain. If you find yourselves wondering about the seemingly-pointless suffering around us, this last rule from the 12 Rules of Life helps us to see things from a different perspective and to balance the good and bad in life so life seems worth living.

## Future cost discounting

Discounting **makes current costs and benefits worth** more than those occurring in the future because there is an opportunity cost to spending money now and there is desire to enjoy benefits now rather than in the future. ... Failure to discount the future costs in economic evaluations can give misleading results.

## **[Misinformation effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-misinformation-effect-2795353)**:

This is the tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event. It is easy to have your memory influenced by what you hear about the event from others. Knowledge of this effect has led to a mistrust of eyewitness information.

## **[Actor-observer bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-actor-observer-bias-2794813)**:

This is the tendency to attribute your own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes. For example, you attribute your high cholesterol level to genetics while you consider others to have a high level due to poor diet and lack of exercise.

## **[Attentional bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-an-attentional-bias-2795027)**:

This is the tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others. For example, when making a decision on which car to buy, you may pay attention to the look and feel of the exterior and interior, but ignore the safety record and gas mileage.

## **[Functional fixedness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-functional-fixedness-2795484)**:

This is the tendency to see objects as only working in a particular way. For example, if you don't have a hammer, you never consider that a big wrench can also be used to drive a nail into the wall. You may think you don't need thumbtacks because you have no corkboard on which to tack things, but not consider their other uses. This could extend to people's functions, such as not realizing a personal assistant has skills to be in a leadership role

## Overconfidence Effect

The overconfidence effect is a well-established bias in which a person's subjective confidence in his or her judgments is reliably greater than the objective accuracy of those judgments, especially when confidence is relatively high. Overconfidence is one example of a miscalibration of subjective probabilities.

## The It’ll- Get-Worse-Before-It-Gets-Better Fallacy

In conclusion: if someone says ‘It’ll get worse before it gets better,’ you should hear alarm bells ringing. But beware: situations do exist where things first dip and then improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates loss of pay. The reorganisation of a business also takes time. But in all these cases, we can see relatively quickly if the measures are working. The milestones are clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens.

## Illusion of Control

The illusion of control consists **of overestimating the influence that our behavior exerts over uncontrollable outcomes**. Available evidence suggests that an important factor in development of this illusion is the personal involvement of participants who are trying to obtain the outcome.

Example of the illusion of control: **you enter the lottery and win millions**. You assume that this is (partly) a result of how good your lucky numbers are. In fact, lotteries are totally random so you can't influence them with the numbers you choose

YOU CONTROL LESS THAN YOU THINK

## Incentive Super-Response Tendency

Keep an eye out for the incentive super-response tendency. If a person’s or an organisation’s behaviour confounds you, ask yourself what incentive might lie behind it. I guarantee you that you’ll be able to explain 90% of the cases this way. What makes up the remaining 10%? Passion, idiocy, psychosis or malice.

## Outcome Bias

Outcome bias arises **when a decision is based on the outcome of previous events**, without regard to how the past events developed. Outcome bias does not involve analysis of factors that lead to a previous event, and instead de-emphasizes the events preceding the outcomes and overemphasizes the outcome.

## Declinism

The belief that a society or institution is tending towards decline. Particularly, it is the predisposition, possibly due to cognitive bias, such as rosy retrospection, to view the past more favourably and future negatively.

## The Paradox of Choice

## The Inevitability of Unlikely Events: *Coincidence*

In sum: Let’s not get too excited. Improbable coincidences are precisely that: rare but very possible events. It’s not surprising when they finally happen. What would be more surprising is if they never came to be.

WHY THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE MAKES OUR HEADS SPIN

In my ([Rolf Dobelli](http://www.dobelli.com/1177-2)) early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting firm. My boss was a pro when it came to using *anchors*. In his first conversation with any client, he made sure to fix an opening price, which, by the way, almost criminally exceeded our internal costs: “I’ll tell you this now so you’re not surprised when you receive the quote, Mr. So-and-So: We’ve just completed a similar project for one of your competitors and it was in the range of five million dollars.” The *anchor* was dropped: The price negotiations started at exactly five million.

## Gambler’s Fallacy

The **gambler's fallacy**, also known as the **Monte Carlo fallacy** or the **fallacy of the maturity of chances**, is the incorrect belief that, if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa), when it has otherwise been established that the probability of such events does not depend on what has happened in the past. Such events, having the quality of historical independence, are referred to as [statistically independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_independence). The [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) is commonly associated with [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling), where it may be believed, for example, that the next dice roll is more than usually likely to be six because there have recently been fewer than the usual number of sixes.

## The Problem with Averages

And that is the basic problem with averages: they **can hide what you need to know**. Averages hide variation.

## Twaddle Tendency

IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY, SAY NOTHING

When asked why a fifth of Americans were unable to locate their country on a world map, Miss Teen South Carolina, a high-school graduate, gave this answer in front of rolling cameras: ‘I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don’t have maps, and I believe that our education like such as South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future.’ The video went viral.

Catastrophic, you agree, but you don’t waste too much time listening to beauty queens. OK, how about the following sentence? ‘There is certainly no necessity that this increasingly reflexive transmission of cultural traditions be associated with subject-centred reason and future-oriented historical consciousness. To the extent that we become aware of the intersubjective constitution of freedom, the possessive-individualist illusion of autonomy as self-ownership disintegrates.’

## Forecast Illusion

FALSE PROPHETS

Until a few years ago, no one bothered to check. Then along came Philip Tetlock. Over a period of ten years, he evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-appointed professionals.

The result: in terms of accuracy, the experts fared only marginally better than a random forecast generator. Ironically, the media darlings were among the poorest performers; and of those the worst were the prophets of doom and disintegration. Examples of their far-fetched forecasts included the collapse of Canada, Nigeria, China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and the E.U. None of these countries has imploded.

## Effort Justification

Effort justification is the idea that **when people make sacrifices to pursue a goal**, the effort is often rationalized by elevating the attractiveness of the goal. In other words, people sometimes come to love what they suffer to achieve.

## Intention-to-Treat Error

You’ll find it hard to believe, but speed demons drive more safely than so-called careful drivers. Why? Well, consider this: The distance from Miami to West Palm Beach is around seventy-five miles. Drivers who cover the distance in an hour or less we’ll categorize as “reckless drivers” because they’re traveling at an average of 75 mph or more. All others we put into the group of careful drivers. Which group experiences fewer accidents? Without a doubt, it is the “reckless drivers.” They all completed the journey in less than an hour, so they could not have been involved in any accidents. This automatically puts all drivers who end up in accidents in the slower drivers’ category. This example illustrates a treacherous fallacy, the so-called *intention-to-treat error*. Unfortunately, there is no catchier term for it.

## News Illusion

Three years ago, I ([Rolf Dobelli](http://www.dobelli.com/1177-2)) began an experiment. I stopped reading and listening to the news. I canceled all newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Television and radio were disposed of. I deleted the news app from my iPhone. I didn’t touch a single free newspaper and deliberately looked the other way when someone on a plane tried to offer me any such reading material. The first weeks were hard. Very hard. I was constantly afraid of missing something. But after a while, I had a new outlook. The result after three years: clearer thoughts, more valuable insights, better decisions, and much more time. And the best thing? I haven’t missed anything important. My social network—not Facebook, the one that exists in the real world consisting of flesh-and-blood friends and acquaintances—works as a news filter and keeps me in the loop.

## Evolution

Ensembles and time survival. Skin in the game

**Convergent evolution** is similar to parallel evolution, which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.

### **Divergent Evolution**

When people hear the word "evolution," they most commonly think of divergent evolution, the evolutionary pattern in which two species gradually become increasingly different. This type of evolution often occurs when closely related species diversify to new habitats. On a large scale, divergent evolution is responsible for the creation of the current diversity of life on earth from the first living cells. On a smaller scale, it is responsible for the evolution of humans and apes from a common primate ancestor.

### **Convergent Evolution**

Convergent evolution causes difficulties in fields of study such as comparative anatomy. Convergent evolution takes place when species of different ancestry begin to share analogous traits because of a shared environment or other selection pressure. For example, whales and fish have some similar characteristics since both had to evolve methods of moving through the same medium: water.

### **Parallel Evolution**

Parallel evolution occurs when two species evolve independently of each other, maintaining the same level of similarity. Parallel evolution usually occurs between unrelated species that do not occupy the same or similar niches in a given habitat.

Whereas convergent evolution involves unrelated species that develop similar characteristics over time, divergent evolution involves species with a common ancestor that change to become increasingly different over time.Nov 8, 2020

Dollo's law of irreversibility (also known as Dollo's law and Dollo's principle), proposed in 1893[1] by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo states that, "an organism never returns exactly to a former state, even if it finds itself placed in conditions of existence identical to those in which it has previously lived ... it always keeps some trace of the intermediate stages through which it has passed."[2]

## Gini Coefficient

## Complex system with conditions

In economics, the Gini coefficient, also the Gini index and the Gini ratio, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality within a nation or a social group. The Gini coefficient was developed by the statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.

## Critical race theory

Critical race theory is a cross-disciplinary intellectual and social movement of civil-rights scholars and activists who seek to examine the intersection of race and law in the United States and to challenge mainstream American liberal approaches to racial justice.

CRT has five tenets: **Counter-Storytelling, the Permanence of Racism, Whiteness as Property, Interest Convergence, and the Critique of Liberalism**. These tenets help to highlight the origin and current manifestations of racial oppression, discrimination, and inequality found within the fabric of American culture.

## Philosophy

# Totality of the circumstances

In the law, the totality of the circumstances test refers to a method of analysis where decisions are based on all available information rather than bright-line rules. Under the totality of the circumstances test, courts focus "on all the circumstances of a particular case, rather than any one factor".

# Relationships

## Reasons to be optimistic

Life Reimagined asked McClintock to comment on the Hollywood formula of older male stars mating with much younger women. “I think people are biased toward observing the instances when older men do marry younger women, or ugly men marry pretty women, and to not noticing the instances when couples are roughly the same age or equally attractive. Take Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. No one ever comments about their similarity in beauty. People have a similar recall bias for all sorts of things For example, we notice and remember when there is traffic and we don't notice or remember when there was not traffic. So casual observation is not reliable in evaluating the prevalence of trophy wife couples.”

- Ugly parentes
- Pictures of you in the past
- Who to date- variability of attractiveness
- Adults have few situations with regular contact
- lovely ones only ever have their looks by the utterly chance arrangement of DNA sequences.
- The move might have been focused on the appreciation of industrial architecture, but it had a global significance and application, for by looking carefully at many things, almost anything, we may learn to see attractive qualities in unexpected places – not least, in the human face.
- We should feel sympathy for ourselves. The challenges of how we might find love are highly complex, seldom systematically explored and – relatively – brand new. We’ve been looking for love the way we do now for, at best, only 260 years. We’re still at the dawn of determining how to get into good relationships. Signs of our missteps are all around us.
- Maybe I am her type
- The most distinctive aspect of our instinct in love is its *particularity*. We aren’t capable of falling in love with just anyone; we are powerfully led by our ‘types’. We may reject a good many candidates who – on paper – could seem perfect to onlookers. We may not be able to explain much more about their inadequacies than to say weakly that they didn’t ‘feel right’. And alternatively, we can be powerfully impelled towards other candidates, this time less clearly suitable, for reasons wholly beyond our conscious command. We are extremely, fascinatingly *choosy*.
- I may have strengths she doesn't
- We don't fall for what is right but what is familiar
- Women with secure attachment style may just think you are not interested or already in a relationship
- Women with anxious attachment style may think you don’t like them

## Completion

One of the most powerful forces within love is the Instinct for Completion. We are, all of us, radically incomplete: we lack a range of qualities in our characters, psychological but also physical. We might be missing calm, creativity, practical know-how, wit, strength, sensitivity… It is as if, somewhere within us, we recognise this incompleteness and experience an attraction whenever we enter the orbit of someone who possesses a complimentary quality. We seek – through love – to make good a defect and to complete ourselves.

As all of us have very different kinds of incompleteness, so it stands to reason that we will find very different people attractive. Certain candidates will have qualities that leave us cold – simply because we have these in spades already: we may not need (for example) someone who is as calm as we are. Things would threaten to get dangerously too quiet. It’s an injection of creativity and irreverence (say) that we might need. Our tastes will be as varied as our deficiencies.

This mechanism of attraction in love is similar to the mechanism of attraction we may have around styles of architecture and design. When it comes to buildings and interiors, we also operate with an instinct for completion. The places we call ‘beautiful’ are (like the people we call ‘attractive’) often those that have qualities we want but don’t yet have enough of. Consider two very different buildings:

### Peterskirche, Vienna, 1733

The way we approach love as adults is highly shaped by how we experienced love as children. We will in adulthood be attracted to people that remind us – more or less unconsciously – of the people we loved as children. The idea feels unnerving because of a natural feeling of disgust around thinking of parental figures as sexual. But this is not the point.
